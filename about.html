                                Isaiah Villar, for the last decade, has been honing his craft as a singer-songwriter and producer. With each project being more 
                            ambitious than the previous, Villar has always left his fans to “expect nothing”; from topics including growing up and accepting adulthood on 
                            Growing Up (2018) to coping with addiction and heartbreak with both Loss of Innocence (2020)
                            and Rough Night In Riverside (2020).</p>
                            <p class='sammy-wrap3'>
                                Almost two years after releasing his last album, Isaiah Villar returns with his fourth album, 
                            CYCLES OF CHANGE (2022). This album follows up on the topics discussed in his previous two albums with a new perspective.
                            </p>
                            <p class='sammy-wrap3'>
                                Today, Villar continues to push himself further, exploring different genres to shape his sound for 
                            future releases. Being a multi-faceted creative, he has also done work in photography, video, and even made the very website you're looking at right now.
                            </p>
                            <p class='sammy-wrap3'>
                                This is just the beginning of what Isaiah Villar has in store.

                                This website is meant to be fully interactive. While there are obvious links that will lead you to 
                                the right place (examples: music, videos, contact info, etc), there are hidden links in the website 
                                within photos and buttons that lead to other places (whether its a Youtube video or unreleased material from the archive).</p>
                            <p class='sammy-wrap3'>
                                The website features almost everything that I've done thoughout the last four albums. Keep in 
                                mind, some of the videos are not featured anymore due to the newfound goal of 
                                keeping my personal life private. As I felt like some older videos reveal too much about my life. 
                            </p>

                                Even though I intergrated this website for mobile phones, this site works best 
                                on a computer/laptop. The experience still works on a mobile device (it's just harder to 
                                find the hidden links). Overall, the choice is yours on how deep within you'll want to go in this website.
