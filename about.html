                                For the last decade, Isaiah Villar has been honing his craft as a multi-faceted artist working on every aspect of everything he does from the music, 
                                the artwork, and even the videos. With each project being more ambitious than the last, Villar has always left fans to “expect nothing,”; 
                                with the Indie Pop sounds of “Growing Up” (2018), the Experimental Rock featured in “Loss of Innocence” (2020), 
                                the Folk-Rock storytelling of “Rough Night in Riverside,” and the Electronic sounds in “CYCLES OF CHANGE” (2022).
                            </p>

                                Making an album has always been challenging for Villar, however, Villar’s upcoming fifth album and second act to his faith trilogy, 
                                “??? ??? ?????” has proved to be his most ambitious project yet spanning over four years of work and planning. 
                                Exploring the ideas of trials, tribulation, and suffering, Villar hopes to make an album that captures the anxieties of those experiences
                                while bringing hope in the midst of it all.

                                Along with his side projects, The Sleepless Society (with Taylor Taxdal, MK Pena, and David Amado) and 
                                nhm. (with Bobby Rigo and Mat Nee), Villar continues to push himself further, exploring different genres to shape his sound.

                                This is just the beginning of what Isaiah Villar has in store.

                                This website is meant to be fully interactive. While there are obvious links that will lead you to 
                                the right place (examples: music, videos, contact info, etc), there are hidden links in the website 
                                within photos and buttons that lead to other places (whether its a Youtube video or unreleased material from the archive).</p>
                            <p class='sammy-wrap3'>
                                The website features almost everything that I've done thoughout the last five albums. Keep in 
                                mind, some of the videos are not featured anymore due to the newfound goal of 
                                keeping my personal life private. As I felt like some older videos reveal too much about my life. 
                            </p>

                                Even though I intergrated this website for mobile phones, this site works best 
                                on a computer/laptop. The experience still works on a mobile device (it's just harder to 
                                find the hidden links). Overall, the choice is yours on how deep within you'll want to go in this website.
