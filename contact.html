                            some time instead of contacting me through email. </p>

                        Currently, I've been doing a lot of research on how to pull off a great live show in the 
                        same quality as the albums and music videos I've released so far, so the idea is still in mind. However, there are several factors at 
                        hand that are preventing me from starting to book these shows.
                        </p>

                    <p class='sammy-wrap3'>
                        Mainly, I've been investing most of my time
                        working on more music as well as tending to my day jobs. Similar to acts like The Beatles and Avicii,
                        I would rather prefer to spend more time working on new material. The other factor (if I decide to start booking shows) would involve me saving up money for the 
                        basic gear needed to pull off the live show since all of the operations regarding my music are run soley by myself and out
                        of my own pocket. 
                    </p>

                    <p class='sammy-wrap3'>
                        I would love to do a few shows someday, so hopefully I could resolve these issues soon. However, at the moment, my focus is mainly not there.

                            Yes, I want to do what Luke from Gilmore Girls does even though I don't drink coffee. 
                            I just think what he does seems pretty cool.
                            That being said, people do ask this question A LOT. 
                            I still don't know how to respond to it. There's a lot of things that I want to do, but I can never predict what may happen in five years.
                            I may say one thing, and then it changes to a whole different direction.

                        When I wrote "Rough Night In Riverside" (the last song off the album), I really liked the name that I gave for that particular song, which
                        inspired me to name the whole album off that one song. Maybe one day I'll tell the <a href="https://youtu.be/CwmtkFPYXsg" target="blank">story</a> of 
                        what truly inspired that song, but now is not the time. That being said, it's all in
                        the title. It was a <em><strong>rough</strong></em> night .......in Riverside.</p>
